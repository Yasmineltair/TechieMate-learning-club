1-Partner every developer-to-be with another who wants to find their way into the same tech track, this will keep both of them having the energy to push themselves forward, they will discuss topics in their coursesâ€™ materials whenever any of them need help.
2- There will be a lobby for users in the same track and/or course to discuss what they find challenging, and help one another.
3- We will provide our users with roadmaps along with previously agreed course contents, along with referrals to certified courses, with options based on languages and the amount they agree to pay for the courses.
